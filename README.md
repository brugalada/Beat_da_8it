# Beat da 8it
16bit-like beat 'em up side-scroller rhythm game. 

# Story
In a futuristic world, for reasons yet unknown, humnas have started developing mind-boggling habilities. This has forced socities to re-adapt: some managed to build better socities... others are ruled by the strongest. 
Our protagonists are twins, whose parents got killed by the ruler of one of the worst city states in the face of the Earth. Their vengance will take them from the bottom of the bottom all the way to the top, using only their fists.

# Gameplay
The core gameplay revolves around the innate special habilities of the twins. One has the hability to produce music just by imagining it. The ultimate music composer! The other, a brawler, has the hability to increase the power of the punches as long as they are syncronised to the rhythm of the music. 
Each level is one song and has a limited duration. The song builds up to the climax which is the final boss of the stage. Ideally, the player must sustain the combo all the way to the boss so that, by the time you fight it, your punches can deal enough damage to stun it. There are mechanisms to recover, of course, but in the harder difficulties you will have to play flawleslly to have a chance at beating the bosses. 
The player has the freedom to increase or decrease the BPM of the song, thus introducing a risk-reward mechanic. Higher damage output but it is harder to keep the combo. 

# Artstyle
Pixel art, retro-cyber-punk, bright colors dominated by reds, purples and yellows. High constrast scenarios that vibe to the beat of the song. Over the top character design.
